      <p> This website will be your #No.1 destination if you are completely new to crochet! ( ^ w ^ ) <br>
     I will have the following information in this site: </p>
      <ul>
      <li> Home Page
      <li> Types Of Stitches
      <li> Video Tutorials
      <li> Patterns
      <li> Business Tips
      <p> Before we get started, let's go through some equipment you would need.</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Yarn</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Any yarn works perfectly fine, but I would recommend bright colours so it's easier to use for the first time<br>
          Acrylic yarn and medium worsted yarn would be perfect! </p>

          <ul>

          </ul>
